## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to take a few times to understand media queries for responsive layout and I will continue learning about that. For now I have found out how to center vertically and horizontally the div in the ui using Flexbox. I am working this to apply what I have learned by doing this kind of projects.

### Continued development

I still need to learn about how to structure html tag element properly for both mobile and desktop version. Moreover, I will have to continue practicing responsive layout using media queries.

### Useful resources
